- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @purpler3m
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automating different things in python, data related projects, and security
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science and AWS to enhance my security skills.
- Created this github to start storing all my code for different automating tasks in python.  There may be code in other languages as i continue in my journey.
